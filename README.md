# About SDOSS
The SDOSS code has been initially developped by Zharkov et al., 2005 (DOI: 10.1007/s11207-005-5005-7) in the framework of the EGSO European project.
The code is now daily run to feed the Heliophysic Feature Catalogue (HFC), a service of the HELIO European Virtual Observatory project (http://www.helio-vo.eu/).
