 Before running the SDOSS-HFC wrapper library,
 please set up the required environment variables.
 (Dedicated shell scripts can be found in the /prod
 and /devtest directories.)

 Configuration files providing input
 parameters for SDOSS are stored in the /config
 sub-directory.

 Scripts are available in the /scripts sub-directory
 to run the program.
